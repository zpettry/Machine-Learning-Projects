HTTP Log Anomaly Detection - DBSCAN
=======================================

For this particular project I wanted to focus on just using machine learning algorithms. I took the weblog data from my Autoencoder project and took another look through unsupervised machine learning algorithms. DBSCAN stood out to me as something that could be effective in implementing an anomaly detection paradigm. I have included my Jupyter notebook and requisite data that can be looked at and possible be re-run for testing or for your own purposes. The first data entry is something I added to verify anomaly detection.
